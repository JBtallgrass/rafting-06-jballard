Summary of Components
    1. README.md (Project Intent & Goals)

        â—‹ Clearly outlines the problem statement, goals, and expected insights.
        â—‹ Emphasizes real-time streaming of rafting feedback and environmental data.
        â—‹ Provides setup instructions and links for prerequisites.
        â—‹ Introduces predictive insights and performance tracking.
    2. Rafting Producer (rafting_producer.py):
        â—‹ Generates and streams JSON feedback data into Kafka (rafting_feedback topic).
        â—‹ Runs multiple data generation scripts (utils_generate_rafting_data.py, utils_generate_river_flow.py, utils_generate_weather_data.py).
        â—‹ Handles errors gracefully and ensures Kafka services are running.
        â—‹ âœ… Good logging and structured steps for producer execution.
    3. CSV Rafting Producer (csv_rafting_producer.py):
        â—‹ Consumes CSV-style messages from rafting_csv_feedback and republishes to processed_csv_feedback.
        â—‹ Assigns trip status and flags disruptions based on bad weather conditions.
        â—‹ âœ… Structured message transformation and clear processing logic.
        â—‹ ðŸ”§ Consider: More flexible topic configuration (allow env variables for topics).
    4. Rafting Consumer (rafting_consumer.py):
        â—‹ Reads rafting trip feedback and enriches it with weather & river conditions.
        â—‹ Flags negative comments and logs them separately.
        â—‹ Maintains weekly guide performance trends.
        â—‹ Saves negative feedback to JSON for analysis.
        â—‹ âœ… Great for monitoring trends and improving guide accountability.
        â—‹ ðŸ”§ Consider: Configurable logging thresholds for alerts (high negativity weeks).
    5. CSV Rafting Consumer (csv_rafting_consumer.py):
        â—‹ Reads JSON feedback and transforms it into CSV-friendly format.
        â—‹ Republishes structured feedback to rafting_csv_feedback.
        â—‹ Logs weather & river conditions alongside feedback.
        â—‹ âœ… Great step for structured reporting and integration into analytical tools.
ðŸ”§ Consider: Support for additional metadata (e.g., timestamps for better trend analysis)
