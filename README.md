### 📌 Project Overview  

This project demonstrates how to build a **streaming analytics pipeline** using **Apache Kafka**, **Python**, and a **relational database (SQLite)** for data storage. It simulates real-time data generation, ingestion, and processing while storing processed data in a structured database for further analysis and integration with BI tools.

## 🌊 Rafting Feedback Streaming Project Description

This project is designed to **stream, process, and analyze real-time customer feedback** from rafting trips on the **French Broad River, NC**, using **Apache Kafka**. It integrates customer reviews with **weather and river flow conditions**, providing valuable insights into trip experiences and environmental impacts.

### ⚠️ Note: ⚠️
The data in this project is **fictitious** with the use of  **Generative AI (GenAI)** assistants to **generate, problem-solve, and debug** the process.

### 🎯 Goals  
- **Real-time processing** of structured (CSV) and semi-structured (JSON) data.  
- **Automated enrichment** of feedback with weather and river conditions.  
- **Performance tracking** for rafting guides based on customer reviews.  
- **Predictive insights** into trip satisfaction and environmental impact.  

### 🚣 Data Sources  
- **Customer Feedback**: Reviews from rafting trip participants.  
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.  
  - [weather details](docs/wx-rafting.md)
- **River Flow Levels**: Water level, current speed, and temperature.  
  - [river details](docs/rv-rafting.md)

### ⚡ Technologies Used  
- **Apache Kafka**: Real-time message streaming and processing.  
- **Python**: Data generation, transformation, and analytics.  
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management.  
- **Loguru**: Logging feedback and performance.  
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization for performance trends.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **VS Code**: Development environment.  
- **SQLite**: Relational database for storing processed data.  

### 🔑 Key Features  
- **Real-time data ingestion** from a Kafka topic or a live data file.  
- **Data storage and processing** in SQLite, demonstrating integration with relational databases.  
- **Multiple consumer options**: File-based consumer for testing or Kafka-based consumer for real-time processing.  

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Requirements

### ✅ Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Kafka & Zookeeper** installed and running.
    - bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
    - bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
  - **Virtual Environment** set up for dependency management.

### 📥 Installation and Setup

1. Clone the project:
   
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   
3. Install dependencies:
  
4. Set up Kafka and Zookeeper:
   Follow the instructions in [Kafka Install Guide](Jballard_docs/kafka-install-guide.md).

5. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   ZOOKEEPER_ADDRESS=172.30.179.152:2181
   KAFKA_BROKER_ADDRESS=172.30.179.152:9092
   KAFKA_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30000
   RAFTING_TOPIC=rafting_feedback
   RAFTING_INTERVAL_SECONDS=2
   ```

## 🔹 Project Components

### 1. Data Generation
- **Weather Data** (`utils_generate_weather_data.py`): Generates synthetic weather data for the rafting region.
- **River Flow Data** (`utils_generate_river_flow.py`): Creates realistic river flow conditions.
- **Rafting Feedback** (`utils_generate_rafting_data.py`): Produces customer reviews with a mix of positive and negative feedback.

### 2. Kafka Producers and Consumers
- **Rafting Producer (`rafting_producer.py`)**: Streams generated feedback data to the `rafting_feedback` topic.
- **JSON Consumer (`rafting_consumer.py`)**: Logs all feedback, flags negative comments, and enriches messages with weather and river data.
- **CSV Consumer (`csv_rafting_consumer.py`)**: Processes JSON feedback and republishes it as CSV-friendly structured data.
- **CSV Feedback Consumer (`csv_feedback_consumer.py`)**: Writes structured feedback to a CSV file for analysis.
- **Processed CSV Producer (`csv_rafting_producer.py`)**: Enhances and republishes CSV feedback with status flags and trip disruption alerts.

### 3. Visualization
- **Real-Time Feedback Charts (`jb_project_consumer.py`)**:
  - Positive vs. Negative feedback.
  - Weekly performance trends.
  - Weather impact on feedback.
  - River flow and feedback correlation.

## 🔄 Workflow

Here’s the workflow for the project:
**Data Generation**: The producer (rafting_producer.py) simulates real-time data, streaming messages to a Kafka topic or saving them to a live data file.

**Real-Time Feedback Processing**: Consumers read messages from the Kafka topic or process, enrich the data (e.g., adding weather and river conditions), and store the processed results in the SQLite database for persistence and further analysis.

**Data Storage**: SQLite serves as the data store for processed data, enabling historical reference, integration with BI tools, and deeper insights into rafting feedback.

**Visualization**: jb_project_consumer.py updates real-time charts every 10 messages, visualizing positive vs. negative feedback, weather impact on feedback, and river flow correlations.
