The **weather data** generated by the `utils_generate_weather_data.py` script includes **realistic weather conditions** for the **French Broad River** region from **May to September 2024**. Here's a breakdown of the key attributes:

### **📊 Weather Data Fields:**
| Field            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `date` | The date for which the weather data applies (from May 24, 2024, to September 2, 2024). |
| `temperature` | Air temperature (°F) based on seasonal averages (55-95°F). |
| `weather_condition` | General weather description (e.g., **Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Stormy**). |
| `humidity` | Relative humidity percentage (30-90%). |
| `wind_speed` | Wind speed (0-20 mph). |
| `precipitation` | Rainfall in inches (0 for clear days, 0.1-2.0 inches for rainy/stormy days). |
| `uv_index` | UV exposure index (1-11+). |
| `feels_like` | Adjusted temperature based on wind chill (for cold temps) or heat index (for warm temps). |

### **🌤️ Weather Data Logic**
- **Temperature**:  
  - **May & September:** Cooler (55-85°F).  
  - **June, July, August:** Warmer (65-95°F).  
- **Weather Condition**: Randomly chosen from `"Sunny", "Partly Cloudy", "Cloudy", "Rainy", "Stormy"`.  
- **Precipitation**: Only generated on rainy/stormy days (`0.1 - 2.0 inches`).  
- **Wind Chill / Heat Index** (`feels_like`):
  - If **temperature ≥ 80°F**, a **heat index** is applied.  
  - If **temperature < 50°F** and **wind speed > 3 mph**, a **wind chill** calculation is used.

### **📂 Example Weather Data Entry**
```json
{
    "date": "2024-06-15",
    "temperature": 88,
    "weather_condition": "Partly Cloudy",
    "humidity": 52,
    "wind_speed": 8,
    "precipitation": 0,
    "uv_index": 9,
    "feels_like": 92.4
}
```
- **88°F temperature** with **partly cloudy** skies.  
- **No precipitation** (since it’s not a rainy/stormy day).  
- **Moderate humidity (52%)** and **wind speed (8 mph)**.  
- **UV Index = 9** (high exposure).  
- **Feels Like = 92.4°F** (slightly higher due to heat index).
